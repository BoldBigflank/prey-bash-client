Prey is a small script for tracking your stolen laptop.
It is licenced by the GPLv3 which means you can do just
about anything with it. It runs in *NIX systems.

1. How it works

The script runs at a specified interval in your machine,
and checks for a specified URL in the web. If the URL exists
it means the computer/laptop has been stolen, and thus
goes through the information-gathering routine and sends
all that info through to a previously defined email address.
You can also not define a URL and in that case the program
sends the data every time it runs.

2. Installation

For Mac & Ubuntu/Debian users: just download the package and run the
install script:

$ chmod +x install.sh
$ ./install.sh

For all other distros: download the files, put them anywhere you want,
change the configuration values and then add an entry in root's crontab:

$ sudo crontab -e

For example, if you wish the script to run at an interval
of ten minutes, the crontab line would look like:

*/10 * * * * /usr/local/bin/prey.sh > /dev/null

3. Usage

The idea is that when your laptop gets stolen -- hopefully never, that is --
you should immediately create the URL you specified in Prey's
configuration. You actually don't need to put anything in it, since what
triggers the application is the status code 200.

That's it! Feel free to fork the repo and contribute if you want to.

Prey works thanks to Michal Ludvig's excellent command-line SMTP client
and Axel Bauer's iSightCapture program for capturing pictures on the
Mac. And of course, a bunch of powerful open source utilities!
