# Prey - Track down your stolen laptop

# A project by Tomas Pollak
##############################################

Prey is a lightweight application for tracking your stolen laptop.

It runs in Windows and *NIX systems as well (Mac, Linux). It is licenced
by the GPLv3 which means you can do just about anything with it.

##############################################
1. How it works
##############################################

The script runs at a specified interval in your machine, and checks
for a specified URL in the web. If the URL exists it means the
computer/laptop has been stolen, and thus goes through the information
gathering routine and sends all that info through to a previously defined
email address. You can also not define a URL and in that case the program
will send the data every time it runs.

You can also use the Prey web control panel (control.preyproject.com)
to manage the computer state, as well as toggling different modules for
triggering certain behaviours remotely. In this case you don't have to
worry about the URL thing since it takes care of that for you. You only
need to register and insert the API and Device keys in the Prey
configuration.

##############################################
2. Installation
##############################################

 -- Windows, Mac & Ubuntu Linux users

Download the package/installer and run it.

Once all files are in place you’ll need to configure Prey, where you’ll
be able to choose between both operation modes. In case you want to use
Prey along with the control panel (recommended), you’ll have to register
and add your device to obtain your API and Device keys. Prey needs them
both so make sure you add them correctly.

If you want to use Prey in an independent way, you’ll have to set up your
mail server (SMTP) settings. Sometimes email sending doesn’t work at once,
so please try using a different target mailbox just in case — in fact
that’s how the problem generally gets fixed.

 -- Linux users (not Debian/Ubuntu)

Once you’ve downloaded the package, unzip it and execute the installation
script. It will prompt for all the necesary fields, and even sign up in
Prey for you if case you haven’t registered yet:

	$ chmod +x install.sh
	$ ./install.sh

Note: You should use the full URL in Prey's setup, such as
http://preyproject.com (not just preyproject.com).

##############################################
3. Requisites for Linux
##############################################

Mac comes with everything needed to run Prey. However Linux users should make
sure they have the following installed: (note the installer does this
automatically!)

	o curl / wget
	o scrot or imagemagick (for screenshot capture)
	o streamer (for webcam capture) --> in Fedora the xawtv package includes it
	o Perl libs IO::Socket::SSL and NET::SSLeay

##############################################
4. Usage
##############################################

The idea is that when your laptop gets stolen -- hopefully never, that is --
you should immediately activate Prey, by declaring the device as missing
in the control panel, or by creating the URL you specified in Prey's
configuration. This depends on the operation mode (post method) you set up
when installing Prey.

Prey expects a status code 200 to run. If it receives a status 404 it will
simply shut down and wait for the next interval tu check the URL.

Prey is a collaborative project which has kept alive thanks to the help of
diverse contributors, specially these amazing people:

	o Juan Carlos Mardones - http://juanmardones.com

Prey also works thanks to Brandon Zehm's excellent command-line SMTP client
and Axel Bauer's iSightCapture program for capturing pictures on the
Mac. And of course, a bunch of other powerful open source utilities.
