Prey is a small script for tracking your stolen laptop. 
It is licenced by the GPLv3 which means you can do just 
about anything with it.

1. How it works

The script runs at a specified interval in your machine,
and checks for a specified URL in the web. If the URL exists
it means the computer/laptop has been stolen, and thus
goes through the information-gathering routine and sends
all that info through sendmail or mailx to a previously defined
email address.

2. Installation

Just download the script, put it anywhere you want, change the 
configuration values and then add an entry in your users' (or root)
crontab. For example, if you wish the script to run at an interval
of one hour, the crontab line would look like:

0 * * * * /usr/local/bin/prey.sh > /dev/null

3. Usage

The idea is that when your laptop gets stolen -- hopefully never, that is --
you should immediately put a file in the URL you specified in Prey's
configuration. And that's it.
